        Computers are everywhere now. From the Smart TV you have in your living room to the smartphone in your pocket, all of them could be considered computing devices. There are many ways of interacting with these computers - mouse, touchscreen, and even the remote control for that TV - but, the main way of putting text into them is through a keyboard.

        We use different types of keyboards to interact with different devices. You're probably using the touchscreen keyboard for your smartphone or even tablets. And TVs and game consoles have that weird grid-type onscreen keyboard that you have to manually move from one letter to another with the direction pad. However, for desktops, laptops, ( and for some people, tablets), and PCs in general, the regular PC keyboard is still the main text input device.

        Keyboards are often classified based on how they turn a pressed key into a letter on the screen. That process is called actuation and we'll learn more about it later. First, we're gonna talk about the different actuation types that keyboards use. Old keyboards use a metal spring that buckles or bends and touches an electrical contact to actuate, these are called buckling-spring keyboards. While most modern keyboards uses a soft, rubbery membrane that touches a pcb underneath to register a key input, they're also known as membrane keyboards. See how the names are related to how they actuate?
        
        Now, why are they called mechanical keyboards? Mechanical keyboards use switches that mechanically push two metal conductors together which completes a circuit to actuate and register a key input. Sounds like old buckling-spring keyboards, huh? That's because buckling-spring keyboards are also considered mechanical keyboards. But here in Mech.Me we focus on modern mechanical keyboards that uses Cherry MX style keyswitches. So, join us as we take a deeper dive into the weird and wonderful niche of Mechanical Keyboards!
